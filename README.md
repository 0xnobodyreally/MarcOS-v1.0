# MarcOS v1.0

**MarcOS v1.0**   -   This Sketch is divided in multiple Tabs

  MarcOS is a simple menu for your TouchScreen Display of your Arduino.
  It works best with an Arduino Mega but it can also work with an Arduino UNO/NANO
  (although it will use quite a bit of storage and memory).


  **IMPORTANT:** You might need to replace the Libraries for Touch Display with the ones
  for your own display and re-calibrate the touch-button coordinates to match the
  ones of your display.


  **CALIBRATE TOUCH:** Once you upload this sketch to your Arduino, open the Serial Monitor
  and touch the display on the button's borders  to see the coordinates of the point
  you've touched. If these don't match with the coordinates in the code, replace them
  with the correct values for your display.
