## TFT Library

This is the library of the 3.5" TFT screen that I used while developing MarcOS. If you have a different display you will need to use the correct library for your display and amend the code accordingly.

* To install this Library load it from your Arduino app or unzip it and move it into your Arduino Libraries folder
